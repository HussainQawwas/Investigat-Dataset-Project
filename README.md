# Investigat-Dataset-Project
This is the project I have done at the end of the first course in Udacity's data analyst Nano-degree. This project simply is a trip through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. It requires to analyze a dataset and then communicate findings about it, using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
